  "OnlineListsDescription": "Online lists are a collection of images under a common name. The preview thumbnails and the metadata of the images will be saved into the database, but the sample and original images will always be downloaded from the original provider. It is a good way of maintaining a collection of images without downloading them.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that if the original provider decides to remove the image, then TsukiTag will not be able to re-download it from the provider. You can always take a look at the saved metadata to locate the original source though (if it was available).",

The file name of the downloaded image can be set in the workspace settings.
