  "OnlineListsDescription": "Online lists are a collection of images under a common name. The preview thumbnails and the metadata of the images will be saved into the database, but the sample and original images will always be downloaded from the original provider. It is a good way of maintaining a collection of images without downloading them.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that if the original provider decides to remove the image, then TsukiTag will not be able to re-download it from the provider. You can always take a look at the saved metadata to locate the original source though (if it was available).",

  "ProviderTagsDescription": "These tags will be directly sent to the online providers.\r\n\r\nAll online providers have common wildcard support and exact match support, such as:\r\nhair_between_eyes - exact match\r\nhair_* - tags starting with 'hair_'\r\n*_eyes - tags ending with '_eyes'\r\n*between* - tags which contain 'between'\r\n\r\nDanbooru has a global tag limit of 2, meaning that you cannot do searches with more than 2 tags specified, and if using wildcards, the wildcard will not match to more than 2 tags.\r\n\r\nThere is support on the online provider side for excluding tags from results, but these will take up a tag slot each.\r\nYou can use the client side excluding feature on the right to exclude niche tags without taking up a tag slot.\r\n-hair_between_eyes - exclude images with this tag\r\n\r\nThere is support on the online provider side for returning images with a specific rating, but this will take up a tag slot.\r\nYou can use the switches under the 'session' menu item on the left to exclude images with a specific rating on client side, without taking up a tag slot.\r\n-rating:safe - only return images with 'safe' rating\r\n\r\nThere is support on the online provider side for sorting posts by for example score. The sorting keyword is being tailored to match the online provider rules before sending.\r\nsort:score\r\norder:score\r\n\r\nThere is support on the online provider side for returning posts with a score higher than a specific amount:\r\nscore:>5 - return pictures which have higher than 5 score rating\r\n\r\nFor a complete comprehensive list, visit each provider's main website and documentation. Note that if a specific syntax just only works with one online provider, the others will not return results for your search.",
